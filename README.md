# Getting and Cleaning Data


## Course Project


The directions for this project were to take the data from ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), and create an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.



### The steps that must be performed to run the finished script are as follows:

1. Download the `run_analysis.R` script to your working directory.
2. Run ```source("run_analysis.R")```.


### Dependencies

:
- The ```dplyr``` R package must be installed prior to running this script.  It can be installed using the ```install.packages``` command in R.




### You can read more about the data and the analysis in the [code book](CodeBook.md).
